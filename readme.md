# Health Checker App
This app is a simple "Daily Health Check" app written in swift and made using XCode storyboards. This program was delveoped as a final project for our CS 3240 (Mobile Device Programming) class, and was made with use of some niche features in mind.

## Some fun features:
* Persistent Data through UserDefaults in Xcode.
* Custom table view tied to URLs with error catching.
* Navigation Controller layout following through the entire app navigation.
